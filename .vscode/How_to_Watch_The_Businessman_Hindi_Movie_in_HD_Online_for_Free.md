## What are the critics saying about The Businessman?
 
The Businessman received mixed reviews from the critics, who praised Mahesh Babu's performance and Puri Jagannadh's direction, but criticized the lack of novelty and logic in the story. The film was also compared to Puri Jagannadh's previous hit Pokiri, which also starred Mahesh Babu as a mafia don.
 
Some of the positive reviews are:

> "The Businessman has a mix of action, image, dialogue and montage but what makes it entertaining is that all the above quantities are inextricably bound and linked together at every level with an admirably tight script. It is a regular story but structurally, technically and content wise, the director makes no mistakes."[^1^]

> "Music by Thaman is an asset. The background music is pretty good. Cinematography by Sam K Naidu is nice. The best part of the film is dialogues penned by Puri Jagan."[^5^]

Some of the negative reviews are:

> "Businessman is not a regular film with the regular dose of action, comedy and entertainment. It is a serious film and hence its appeal is very limited. The film may be liked by the fans of Mahesh Babu but for the general audiences it is just an average film that has nothing new or exiting to offer."[^4^]
